## 🔍 Problems Identified & Resolved

### **1. Reports Page Error**

**Problem:** `SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/App.jsx?t=1751555019210' does not provide an export`

**Root Cause:** Circular dependency and conflicting AuthContext definitions between App.jsx and separate AuthContext file.

**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED**

- Moved AuthProvider logic to dedicated `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Removed duplicate AuthProvider from App.jsx
- Fixed import/export structure
- Eliminated circular dependencies

### **2. Business Dashboard Error**

**Problem:** Multiple component-related errors and authentication issues

**Root Cause:** Same AuthContext circular dependency affecting component loading

**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED**

- Centralized authentication state management
- Proper AuthContext provider structure
- Clean component hierarchy

---

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Implemented

### **AuthContext Restructure**

```javascript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
// App.jsx had duplicate AuthProvider + imported AuthContext
import { AuthContext } from './contexts/AuthContext';
// ... duplicate AuthProvider definition in same file

// AFTER (Fixed)
// Clean separation of concerns
import { AuthContext, AuthProvider } from './contexts/AuthContext';
// AuthProvider logic moved to dedicated file
```

### **Centralized Authentication**

- ✅ Single source of truth for authentication state
