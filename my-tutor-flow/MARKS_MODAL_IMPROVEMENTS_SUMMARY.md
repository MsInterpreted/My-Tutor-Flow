### 2. ✅ Subject Dropdown Fix

**Resolved "No subjects available" issue and implemented robust subject handling**

**Root Cause Fixed:**

- Component was trying to fetch data directly from Firebase instead of using firebaseService
- Missing fallback system for students without defined subjects

**Solutions Implemented:**

- Updated mock student data to include proper `subjects` arrays:
  - Student 1: Mathematics, English, Science, History
  - Student 2: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English
  - Student 3: Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics
  - Student 4: Mathematics, English, Science, Geography, Foreign Language
- Modified component to accept `student` prop for direct subject access
- Added firebaseService integration for data fetching
- Implemented comprehensive fallback system with common subjects

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Data Persistence

**Improved database operations and data consistency**

**New Features:**

- Added missing CRUD operations to firebaseService:
  - `addMarkForStudent()`
  - `updateMarkForStudent()`
  - `deleteMarkForStudent()`
- Enhanced mockDataService with corresponding methods
- Fixed data field naming consistency (`term` and `mark` instead of `test` and `marks`)
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. ✅ Improved User Experience
