- Added proper error handling for Firebase initialization

### 3. Project Structure Cleanup ✅

**Problem**: Multiple conflicting project setups causing confusion
**Solution**:

- Consolidated into single Vite + React structure
- Removed duplicate dependencies
- Organized files into logical directories
- Created clear separation of concerns
