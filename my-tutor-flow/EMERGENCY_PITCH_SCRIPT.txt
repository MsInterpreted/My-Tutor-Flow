‚Ä¢ 85% Mobile Usage
‚Ä¢ 0 Mobile-First Solutions

SCRIPT:
"The problem is clear - education technology is stuck in the desktop era. 85% of users are on mobile, but there are ZERO mobile-first education solutions. We have 170,000 Solana Mobile users in a $7.8 billion market with no one serving them properly."
